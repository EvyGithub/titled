# Titled
A Brainfuck+2 clone but instead of taking code as input, it takes code as itself.
<hr>
Ok so an implementation must read from its own file name, then execute that code ignoring the file extension.

Check it out on the [esolangs.org wiki page](esolangs.org/wiki/Titled)

Im too lazy to describe the language here

Also every implementation here will include a hello world program.

If a language can't read from its file name or any other files' name, then a fallback could be to read its source code (and setting a variable to the code is cheating). In that case, the TItled code will always be on the first line, and commented out or skipped if necessary.
